This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Constants.manifest` to access app information within a background task.  The `Constants.manifest` object might be undefined or incomplete when accessed from a background task, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. This is because the app's manifest data might not be fully loaded before the background task starts executing. For example, trying to access `Constants.manifest.name` within a background task might throw an error if `Constants.manifest` is undefined or the `name` property is missing.
